Revision history for Perl module Ed2k_link

20090419  2009-04-19
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

20090427  2009-04-27
        Some punctuation symbols in filenames aren't percent-enoded anymore (as in eMule).
        Fixed error, which could halt your script if you have link for file < 9mb and touch full hashset (e. g. 'equal' method).

20090428  2009-04-28
        Again percent-encoding. Previous changes brought in a serious error: percent-encoding didn't work at all.
